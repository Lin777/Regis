# Add a Volunteer to the conference

When you want to register a volunteer or you want to assign someone like a volunteer, you have two options:
 
 * Create a new user with a *Student Volunteer* role, which are the same steps as [create an user](https://github.com/Lin777/Regis/blob/master/FAQ/CreateAnUser.md).
 
 * Assign an attendee as a volunteer.
